## Overview
**Archangel** modules are the core components of the synth. They range from **traditional synth components** (oscillators, envelopes, filters, etc.) to **effects** (reverb, flanger, compressor, etc.) to more technical plugins (allpass filter, etc.).

While modules are all unique, they have many features and behaviours in common which are described here. Individual modules have their own page which goes into detail about the module.

## Module management
### Create
To create a module, click on an empty module slot. This will bring up a list of modules. Click one to insert it into the slot

## Connections
### Overview
Connections between modules define the signal flow within the synth. Modules have a single output point that can be connected to as many inputs of other modules as desired. 

*Too many connections will cause lag and unintended audio distortion*

### Making a connection
Click the "Connect" button on the module. This brings up a list of modules. Hovering over a module in the list brings up another list of that module's inputs. Click one of these to connect.

### Deleting a connection

## Presets
